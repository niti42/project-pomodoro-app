# Pomodoro Timer Application

This is a simple **Pomodoro Timer** built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This application automates the timing for work and break sessions.

## Key Features:

- **Work Sessions:** The timer is set for a 25-minute work session by default.
- **Short Breaks:** After each work session, a 5-minute break is triggered.
- **Long Breaks:** Every 4th work session (after 3 short breaks), a longer 20-minute break is triggered.
- **Reset Functionality:** The timer can be reset at any time, returning the session count to zero and clearing any checkmarks.
- **Visual Feedback:** The timer and session status (Work/Break) are displayed visually, along with a tick mark for each completed session.
